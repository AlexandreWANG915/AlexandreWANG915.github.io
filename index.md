## About Me

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Reliable, Efficient, and Autonomous Learning (REAL) Lab, Department of Statistic and Data Science at Northwestern University, under the supervision of <a href="https://kaize0409.github.io/index.html" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-5">Prof. Kaize Ding</a>. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Microelectronics from Sun Yat-sen University, under the guidance of Prof. Shanlin Xiao. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Guangzhou campus, from 2022 to 2023, where I collaborated closely with Prof. Renjing Xu.

Other than my work, I am a big fan of the Golden State Warriors. My favorite basketball player is Steph Curry. Go Warriors!

## Research Interests

I am interested in efficient AI. My current research primarily focus on how to achieve Pareto optimality between model performance and energy consumption. I also have a keen interest in generative AI, such as Diffusion Models and LLMs. I am highly intrigued by the potential crossover between efficient AI, generative AI, and the scientific realm like biomedicine.

- **Efficient AI:** Efficient Transformer Training and Inference, Spiking Neural Networks, Quantization, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning
- **Generative AI:** Diffusion Models, Large Language Models
- **AI for Science:** Molecule Generation, EEG Reconstruction
